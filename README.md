Practice Programs for Different Languages

<h2><b>Functional Programming Languages</b></h2>

▶ In a restricted sense, a functional programming language is one
which does not have mutable variables, assignments, or
imperative control structures.

▶ In a wider sense, a functional programming language enables
the construction of elegant programs that focus on functions.

▶ In particular, functions in a FP language are first-class citizens.
This means

    ▶ they can be defined anywhere, including inside other functions

    ▶ like any other value, they can be passed as parameters to
    functions and returned as results

    ▶ as for other
